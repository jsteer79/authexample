Simple Shared Secret Authenication Example

* install node
* clone repo 
* install dependancies (npm install)
* run test app (npm start)

index.js is the test app
auth.js is the authentication library.

This actually uses 2 secrets the secret and the salt. Ideally the secret should be quite long (16+ char). I am not sure if it is really worth having the salt.
